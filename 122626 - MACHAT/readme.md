Step 2: Design the Signup Page

    In the Flutter Flow editor, navigate to the project you created.
    Click on the "Add Screen" button to create a new screen for the signup page.
    Use the visual editor to design the signup page UI. Drag and drop the necessary components such as text fields for email and password, buttons, and any other desired elements.

    Add an action to the button that will call the Firebase authentication API to create a new user account using the provided email and password.
    Handle any errors that may occur during the signup process and display appropriate error messages to the user.


Step 5: Preview and Export the Code

    Use the preview feature in the Flutter Flow editor to test the signup page and make sure it functions as expected.
